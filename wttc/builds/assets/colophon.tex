\textbf{when the time comes} was composed for the Cygnus Ensemble on a text
written for the work by Paul Griffiths. Scenes 1 -- 6 are to be staged by Joy
Zinoman for premiere on 10 October 2024 in New York City.

\textbf{when the time comes} is dedicated to Paul Griffiths, whose lifetime of
words and music has led generations to ever more extraordinary imaginings of
the two. What the music and staging discover in this work come, everywhere,
from the poet's play of words.
